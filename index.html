                    I am an investigative professional with experience in security, loss prevention, behavioral health,
                    and medicolegal death investigation. I have worked in the private sector as well as the public
                    sector for more than 15 years with experience in management and team leadership. The combined
                    experience has led to the newly accepted role of Program Director of legal studies and business here
                    at Brookline College.

                    I graduated from the University of Phoenix in 2013 with a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice
                    Administration/Management before continuing my education with the University of Phoenix, ultimately
                    graduating with a Master’s Degree in Psychology. Other education includes Forensic Pathology and
                    Death Investigation as well and Biology and Physiology at Pima Community College.

                    I also completed a certificate in interview and Interrogation techniques through Wicklander -
                    Zulawski and Associates in 2012 and a national certification as a Medicolegal Death Investigator
                    through the American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators (ABMDI) in 2017.

                    In my spare time, I enjoy the gym, outdoor activities, and spending time with my wife and two
                    children.
