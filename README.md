Creating a responsive layout 
Creating responsive images 


Throughout this project, I specifically implemented the information I have gathered from the previous course instruction. I am confident that my skills are continuing to evolve as I spend more time working through the code. To create this page I relied on Bootstrap and HTML and CSS.

I don’t consider this assignment “complete” however, I am gaining confidence and understanding while exploring the assets that the programs have to offer. I have learned far more in a short time by immersing myself in the projects and spending time with the code. For this project, I utilized as much as I could in terms of elements and semantics. I also believe I identified some areas of opportunity including making sure my div’s get closed. I sometimes find it difficult to ask for help but I have made a commitment to myself to break through some of my own barriers in the effort to facilitate the most conducive learning environment possible.

As a project, I look forward to the opportunity to revisit this assignment and continue to add to it as I gain more knowledge and skill with coding. At this point in time, this is my first ever coding experience and I find myself becoming slightly obsessed with it.  For me, obsession is a requirement to achieve goals, especially difficult goals. I look forward to the next step on the road to success.
